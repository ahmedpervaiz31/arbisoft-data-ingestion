RestaurantScraper -

scrape_city + scrape_pages: scrapes cities in california and saves them in a txt file for logging
scrape_restaurant: scrapes the restaurants from that txt file and saves their urls in another txt file
scrape_details: scrapes the details from the txt file of restaurant urls - stores in a JSON file
currently, scrape_details does not always extract info - need to check why not
